# Project_1

Using Spotify data from 2010 to 2019 we attempted to identify what components go into a getting a song to the top of the Billboard charts and provide a prediction on which song/artist/genre will be at the top of the Billboard charts in the future.

Performed genre cleanup by creating new genre groups, to narrow down genre type from 50 genres to 7.

Explored the most popular songs by different variables, to gain insight into what makes a successful song.

Acoustical

Acoustic ratings have been trending slightly upwards over the last decade.  Acoustical rankings have stayed within an average range of 10 to 20 for the past decade.  Given the historical data, we predict the acoustics ranking to continue to increase and be in the range of 20 to 25 going forward.

There’s a low correlation between the popularity of a song and the acoustic ranking.  The most popular songs tend to have an acoustics score in the lower quartile.  The data indicates that a song with a higher acoustical rating can be successful, but statically the odds are lower.

Beats Per Minute (BPM)

We expected a BPM increase over the last 10 years, but the real trend is a “Squish”.  Upper outliers seem to be the exception to our findings.  Going forward we expect a bpm range of 90 to 155 


Danceability

The data shows that in the last 5 years the danceability in popular songs has gone up. This trend proves the songs in 2020 that are easy to dance will be more popular.  The energy level and danceability of latin music is the highest. Pop has the most popular songs, but latin music is better to dance to.

Duration

Over time the average duration of the songs was decreasing over time.

Valence

We found a rough correlation between BPM and Valence.  Out of this correlation, we predict that Valence will drop slightly in the future and the BPM value average going forward to level out as the two values begin to realign with each other.
